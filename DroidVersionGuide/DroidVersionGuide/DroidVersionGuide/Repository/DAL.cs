Among the more prominent features introduced with this update were added support for CDMA smartphones, additional screen sizes, a battery usage indicator, and a text-to-speech engine. After the public release of Donut\u2014its official dessert-themed code name the convention employed by Google to designate major Android versions\u2014carriers were quick to follow with its roll out to customers in the form of an over-the-air(OTA) update for compatible smartphones.\",\r\n\"2.0 Eclair API 5\u20137\": \"Android 2.0 Eclair is Google\u2019s 3rd big iteration of Android, not counting the 1.0 initial version. Android 1.5 Cupcake and Android 1.6 Donut came before Eclair. Android 2.0 Eclair actually brought some big steps forward for Android and started shaping up Google\u2019s OS. Let\u2019s check out the changes Google introduced with Android 2.0 Eclair. Expanded Account sync is definitely an important step forward, this feature allows you to add multiple accounts to a device for synchronization of e-mail and contact. Microsoft e-mail support was also added, with combined inbox to browse e-mail from multiple accounts in one page. Bluetooth technology is stepping forward as well, Android 2.1 support has been added by Google. Some neat shortcuts also found their way in this iteration of Android, like the ability to tap a Contacts photo and select whether you want to call, SMS or e-mail that person. You can now also search all saved SMS and MMS messages and set the OS to automatically delete oldest messages in a conversation when the defined limit is reached, which should help greatly with your memory. Google has also added a ton of new camera features, like flash support, digital zoom, scene mode, white balance, color effect and macro focus. The on-screen keyboard experience has also been improved, speed has been improved and the dictionary is now smarter than ever and learns from your word usage and includes contact names as suggestion.

Google did its best to introduce some much-needed fixes to the OS and also introduce new features to it. Android 2.2 Froyo was introduced in May 2010. Google highlighted 4 areas from this update which you should know about, speed, APIs and services, browser and Android Market. As far as speed goes, Google introduced Dalvik JIT (Just In Time) compiler which deliver 2-5x performance boost to the CPU code compared to Android 2.1. Cloud to device messaging was introduced by Google in order to enable the developers to deliver a better experience when it comes to sync and notifications. Application backup API was also added here, welcome automatic restore function. Developers can now also specify if they want to allow users to install applications directly to SD cards or not.

The Gingerbread release introduced support for near field communication (NFC)\u2014used in mobile payment solutions\u2014and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)\u2014used in VoIP internet telephony. Gingerbread's user interface was refined in many ways, making it easier to master, faster to use, and more power-efficient. A simplified color scheme with a black background gave vividness and contrast to the notification bar, menus, and other user interface components. Improvements in menus and settings resulted in easier navigation and system control. The Nexus S smartphone, released in 2010, was the first phone from the Google Nexus line that ran Gingerbread, and also the first one from the line with built-in NFC functionality. Gingerbread uses version 2.6.35 of the Linux kernel.

Honeycomb is a rather unique in a way though, this is a tablet only operating system and as far as Google tells us, it won\u2019t be making its way to smartphones. One notable difference in Honeycomb is that there\u2019s no longer a need for hardware buttons, they\u2019re built into the OS itself. On the bottom left of the screen there are three software buttons: back, home and the app switcher button for multitasking (switching between running apps). On the bottom right you can find some addition info and functionality: power, internet connection status and a notification bar. Within the notification bar you can see download progress, music controls, incoming message profile pictures and so on. There are multiple widget options included with Honeycomb, so you can fill your homescreen with various widgets which will of course offer you all sorts of information and functionality. There\u2019s of course your app drawer included here and tons of other functionality within the OS itself.
